If you are looking for a fast, reliable and easy-to-use software to burn CDs and DVDs, you might want to consider Ahead Nero 8 Lite. This is a stripped-down version of the popular Nero 8 Suite, which includes only the most essential components for disc-related tasks. In this article, we will review the features, benefits and drawbacks of Ahead Nero 8 Lite, and show you how to download it for free.
     
## What is Ahead Nero 8 Lite?
     
Ahead Nero 8 Lite is a software package that contains four applications: Nero Burning Rom, Nero Express, Nero Cover Designer and Nero WaveEditor. These are the most popular and widely used tools from the original Nero 8 Suite, which also includes other components such as Nero Vision, Nero BackItUp, Nero ShowTime and more.
